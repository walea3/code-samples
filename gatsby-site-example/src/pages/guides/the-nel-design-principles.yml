  Design principles are a set of fundamental truths that help us to create
  stronger experiences. They are the common goals that align the disciplines and
  teams working with the NEL system.

          ### 1. 'Done' doesn't exist


          NEL’s design patterns have been tried and tested, and can be used time
          and again. That doesn’t mean anything is definitive. We will
          constantly build on our learnings, to pursue perfection – or very near
          it.

            items:
              - Test everything with users – then test again.
              - Encourage new ideas and make any relevant changes NEL.
              - Make ‘day two’ happen.

              - Accept first iterations as forever solutions.

          ### 2. Collaboration galvanises our common goals


          NEL enables us to collaborate and learn from each other, for a unified
          approach. We’ll share knowledge, build relationships and work
          together, to put our members (and their money) first.

                Listen to different points of view, and explain our rationale to
                others.

                Welcome new insight and evidence that challenges our
                perceptions.

          ### 3. Member in not Society out


          Everything we do, from design to development, will have our members’
          best interest at heart. After all, our members are Noop.

              - >-
                Put the member first in every decision – even if it’s not what
                we personally want to do.

                Let business pressures influence decisions that could have a
                negative impact.
              - >-
                Design to intentionally deter or distract the user from
                achieving their task.

          ### 4. A common language doesn’t stifle expression


          NEL gives us freedom to experiment, and we will never stop exploring
          new ideas. NEL’s design patterns and principles form our common
          language. How we choose to communicate using this language is up to
          us.

                Use appropriate techniques to create consistent visual
                experiences across our digital estate.

            items:

          ### 5. Consistency is key


          We will always be consistent, thanks to Noop’s Experience
          Language. Being consistent helps our members recognise our brand, and
          inspires confidence. Familiar colours, shapes and styles make our
          brand easily identifiable, which in turn builds trust with our members
          – however they choose to interact with us.

                with the NEL team.

          ### 6. Momentum fuels motivation


          We will stay energised by moving at pace. Progress isn’t always easy,
          but keeping up the momentum helps us overcome problems and move
          forward. After all, we will always look to iterate and improve.
