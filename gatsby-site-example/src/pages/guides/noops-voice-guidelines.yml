  Our voice expresses our brand’s unique personality. Although our tone will
  change, our voice remains the same and should be consistent across
  communications.

          Our voice is like no-one else’s – it reflects the very special
          relationship we have with our members.


          Our voice guidelines help us build a brand presence that resonates
          with our members, and keep our writing style consistent. It will help
          us create content that resonates with our members, to build brand
          familiarity.

          Our HELP service principles are designed to build our brand, humanity
          and dependability into the service we deliver. The way we talk to our
          members is part of that. So, we’re using our HELP principles to guide
          the way we talk and write to our members too.

              It’s clear about why and how we’re so different. And it’s
              empathetic, showing our members that we value them and will be
              there for them when they need us.

              It’s conversational and normal, rather than formal. It’s also
              helpful and considerate. It’s about making our members’ lives
              easier by being easy to deal with and understand.

              It’s about recognising the individual. It always talks to our
              members as equals, never parent to child, never telling them how
              to feel. It’s not over familiar but it’s not corporate either.
              it’s warm and respectful, sharing not selling. It’s about family
              and belonging and being there for our members wherever they are in
              life – not really a commercial relationship at all. It’s open and
              honest.

              Attributing a personality to our brand can help us when writing
              for Noop. It helps us imagine how our brand speaks, ensuring
              we bring a human element to our words.
