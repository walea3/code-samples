  Readability measures how easy text is to read on a page. It helps us make sure
  our content can be understood by everyone.


  Readability scores are based on factors such as:

  * complexity

  * typography (line length 55-75 letters)

  * sentence length

  * syllables

  * word familiarity

              - keep line length around 55-57 letters
              - use shorter words
              - break up large blocks of texts where possible
              - user headers to aid skim reading
              - use call out boxes to highlight important text
              - test a page’s readability.

          ### What you'll need


          There are several readability tools to help you define the reading
          age:


          * [Readable.io](https://readable.io)

          * [Webfx readability](https://www.webfx.com/tools/read-able/)


          ### The readability score


          Readability scores gives us a benchmark when writing content. Aim to
          write for a reading age of 9 – the UK average.


          ### Skim reading


          The way we read is changing. Users are spending more time on digital
          devices and reading text on a screen than in print. Studies show that
          this is starting to have an effect on the way we read and digest
          information.


          “Ziming Liu from San Jose State University has conducted a series of
          studies which indicate that the “new norm” in reading is skimming,
          with word-spotting and browsing through the text. Many readers now use
          an F or Z pattern when reading in which they sample the first line and
          then word-spot through the rest of the text.”

          Line length is the length between the left and right edges of a text
          block. Shorter line lengths are easier to read, because your eyes
          don’t have to travel as far; there is less distance between the end of
          one line, and the start of the next.

          ### Sentence length


          Using short sentences is best practise for several reasons:


          * It makes content easier to digest.

          * It’s easier to skim read.

          * It’s best practise from an accessibility point of view.


          The maximum length of a sentence should be 16 words.


          ### Contractions


          Evidence suggests that contractions are difficult to read. They slow
          the user down, and can be misread. On the other hand, avoiding
          contractions can make our voice sound stiff and robotic. So strike a
          balance:


          * use common contractions to strike the right tone (such as ‘it’s’,
          they’re)

          * don’t switch between contractions and the spelled out equivalents on
          the same page

          * avoid using contractions when it is important the user doesn’t
          misinterpret the information

          * never make a contraction out of a noun and a verb.


          A good example would be '**Do not** share your PIN with anyone'


          A bad example would be '**Don’t** share your PIN with anyone’.
