  Icons play an important role on our site. They provide a visual representation
  of the content and are a reflection of our brand. That’s why it’s important to
  create icons in line with our brand style.

          Icons should not be confused with illustrations. They have an entirely
          different purpose and should never be used for decorative purposes.

          We have four types of icons, which are used to convey different
          information or trigger actions.

              Action icons are buttons. The icon should either be created on a
              16px grid (if its total size is 32px) or 20px (if its total size
              is 40px). The icon should be supplied without the outer
              focus/hover state (these are added in the code).

              These sit in line with text, to highlight a message. They should
              be used sparingly and always with the same purpose. They have no
              interaction states.

              They should be supplied at their actual size. Unlike all the other
              icon sets, these should use 3px stroke weights. Before creating a
              system icon, please contact the NEL team, stating the purpose of
              the icon.

              These icons are used for validation and form part of the messaging
              framework. They have no interaction state. Before creating an
              information icon, please contact the NEL team, stating the purpose
              of the icon.

          ### Taking visual cues from the village icon


          Our village icon is a key and recognisable part of our visual
          identity. It consists of a tree, house and a church.


          To create a consistent set of icons, we should take inspiration from
          the village icon wherever possible.


          ![](/img/guide_icon_characteristics_village.png)


          1. **Shapes**<br>
            Use filled shapes such as triangles and circles to evoke the shapes in the logo.

          2. **Strokes**<br>
            Consistent stroke width should be applied.

          3. **Proximity and negative space**<br>
            Proximity is the distance between objects. Negative space is the space within, between and around objects. In the village icon, it’s the space between the tree and the roof. This negative space allows the icon to breathe and adds character.

          4. **Soft corners**<br>
            A key characteristic of our visual identity is the use of soft edges.

          5. **Right angles**<br>
            Right angles are a key visual element of the logo.

          6. **Perspective**<br>
            Our icons should appear front on and not have any perspective or dimensions.

          ### Pixel grids


          When creating icons, objects should be aligned to the pixel grid
          wherever possible. This will speed up the design process and create
          consistency throughout our icon suite.


          Different icon types will adhere to different size grids, but the
          principles will be the same.

          ### Shape


          Different icon types will adhere to different size grids, but the
          principles will be the same.


          ![](/img/guide_icon_characteristics_shape.png)


          ### Stroke weight


          To create a consistent set, we should always use a 2px stroke weight.
          Using a 1px stroke doesn’t render very well on older displays.
        type: richText
      - rules:
          - description: use a consistent 2px stroke

            type: do
          - description: >-
              use 1px strokes as they won't render as strongly and will contrast
              too much with filled shapes.

          ### End caps and round joins

          Where possible we should use round caps and round joins. This can be
          found in the stroke panel in Adobe Illustrator.

          ![](/img/guide_icon_characteristics_end-caps.png)

          ### Proximity

          A minimum of 2px proximity should be applied to spaces between
          objects. This stops elements from appearing visually too close when
          viewed at 100%. When designing an icon, always check the resolution at
          100% to see how it looks from the user's perspective.
        type: richText
      - rules:
          - description: >-
              use a proximity of 2px between objects. In this case the circular
              camera lens has a distance of 2px to the camera body.

            label: 'Do:'
            type: do
          - description: >-
              use less than 1px proximity between objects as they will appear
              too close to each other when viewed at 100%.

            isLarge: false

            type: dont
        type: rulesBlock
      - content: >-
          ### Corner radius

          Consistent use of rounded corners should be applied, using either a
          1px or 2px corner radius. Smaller objects tend to need a smaller
          corner radius.
        type: richText
      - rules:
          - description: use Adobe Illustrator's corner radius box to enter whole numbers.

            label: 'Don''t:'
            type: dont
          - description: exaggerate the rounded corners or use sharp corners

            isLarge: true
            label: 'Don''t:'
            type: dont
        type: rulesBlock
      - content: >-
          ### Perspective

          To create a consistent suite of icons, we should always use a front-on
          view and no perspective.

          ### Adobe Illustrator export settings


          1. Before exporting, ensure icons are outlined. To do this, highlight
          all paths, select the **‘object’** menu, then **‘Expand…’**.

          2. Use the pathfinder to unite your outlined shapes into one compound
          shape. This reduces the complexity of the icons and file size. To do
          this, click **‘Window’** then **‘Pathfinder’**. Highlight all shapes
          and click **‘Unite’**.

          3. **‘Save’** the icon as an SVG using our naming convention. The
          naming should be ‘ICON-TYPE_size_name.icon.svg’, so an example would
          be ‘ACTION_32_clock.icon.svg’.

          4. 'In the SVG options dialog box ensure **‘Responsive’** is not
          ticked. CSS Properties should be set to **‘Presentation Attributes’**.

          ### NEL Approval


          1. Before using the icon, seek approval from the NEL team. To do this,
          email the icon to the team at <mailto:nel@noopdigital.co.uk> and
          explain its usage and function. This ensures we don’t duplicate an
          icon that represents the same information or action.

          2. Once approved the icon will follow the NEL distribution flow,
          including Slack and Sketch library integration.
