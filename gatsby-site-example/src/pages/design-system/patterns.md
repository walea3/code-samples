  Patterns are the fundamental building blocks of the design system.
  
  They can exist in isolation or come together, to make a new pattern. Patterns can also exist within patterns – a dropdown pattern can sit within a card pattern, for example.

  Every pattern is created for a specific need, and with a single purpose. Although the content within the pattern can change, the purpose will always remain the same.
  
  
  New patterns are being established all the time, based on the needs of our digital community. Existing patterns can also be updated – as long as there’s research to support the change.

    Patterns can exist in isolation, or be made from a collection of patterns. Every pattern has a specific purpose, such as a dropdown, a header or a button.
