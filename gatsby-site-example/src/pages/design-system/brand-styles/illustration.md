          Illustration can be used to convey complex information, help users
          complete a task or navigate through our experiences.


          For this reason, it’s important to be considerate of the user’s
          context and sentiment when adding illustration to any experience.

              Wayfinding illustrations give a visual identity to our products
              and services. They provide structure, hierarchy and information,
              helping users orient and navigate through the experience.

              Aesthetic illustration supports users as they move through a
              journey or complete a task. For digital experiences, place
              aesthetic illustration in the user’s peripheral vision – so it
              doesn’t distract from key information.

              Infographics are clear, visual representations that help tell a
              story around complex information, data or knowledge.


              This is not the same as ‘data visualisation’ which is designed to
              present less conceptual, numerical data.

          Illustration should only be used in our [card with image
          pattern](/design-system/patterns/card-with-image) (never in the hero
          pattern).


          As with all imagery, aspect ratio should be set at 16:9, with a
          maximum file size of 150KB.

          Alternative text, or ‘alt text’, is added to an image to help all
          users interpret meaning where they use a screen reader or
          text-to-speech function.


          Alt text can either be added:


          * to code as an ‘alt attribute’.

          * near to the image on screen.


          Alt text should briefly describe key concepts or information
          represented by the image - not simply a description of the image
          itself.


          If the illustration is purely decorative (removing it doesn't affect
          meaning), you don’t need to add alt text. You must add the alt
          attribute though to stop screen readers reading out the image’s file
          name.


          For more guidance on writing alt text, visit the
          [accessibility](www.noop.co.uk/guides/alt-text/666/) site.
