          Our photography is always ‘member-first’, capturing everyday moments
          across local communities, reflecting our values of mutuality,
          diversity & inclusion.

              All of our original photography features real members, capturing
              everyday moments in a candid, authentic style, at home and in the
              community.

              We also capture members in more conceptual scenarios, such as
              doing housework or playing sport.


              Conceptual imagery can be used to draw subtle connections between
              members and a product or headline.

              We use incidental still life scenes (eg toys on the floor or
              washing on a line) as secondary images to support a connection
              between us and our members.

              Sometimes we do have to use stock photos to supplement member
              imagery.


              Where you do use stock photos, the same principles apply – use
              candid-style shots of real people or incidental still life.

          Photography can be used in both hero and card with image pattern.


          As with all imagery, aspect ratio should be set at 16:9, with a
          maximum file size of 150KB.

          When using member imagery, we must include signposting of the member’s
          first name and how long they’ve been a member.


          For Noop.co.uk, add these details to the legal footnotes on page
          and make sure their member number is saved in the image file name.


          See the [Brand hub](https://noop.frontify.com/) for more
          guidance on member photography.

          Set the focal point around the main area of interest (eg the person or
          object) so that no context is lost when the image resizes across
          breakpoints.

          All photographs of people should capture the person not looking
          directly at the camera.


          For digital experiences, make sure the person’s gaze is towards the
          content on the page – helping direct users to key information, without
          being distracted by the image (see below).

          Alternative text, or ‘alt text’, is added to an image to help all
          users interpret meaning where they use a screen reader or
          text-to-speech function.


          Alt text can either be added:


          * to code as an ‘alt attribute’.

          * near to the image on screen.


          Alt text should briefly describe key concepts or information
          represented by the image - not simply a description of the image
          itself.


          If the photo is only decorative (removing it doesn't affect meaning),
          you don’t need to add alt text. You must add the alt attribute though
          to stop screen readers reading out the image’s file name.


          For more guidance on writing alt text, visit the
          [accessibility](http://noop.co.uk) site.
