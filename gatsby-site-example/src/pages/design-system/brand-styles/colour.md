  The colours we use to represent our brand make up a huge part of our identity.
  Consistent use of these colours makes us instantly recognisable, and nurture
  brand familiarity. For this reason, we should never stray from – or alter –
  the brand colours.



  Our colours are meaningful and can help to add context to our design, to
  support usability.

          This is our main colour palette, comprising the three Noop brand
          colours. These are used in our logo, signage, printed material and
          homepage headers.

          Our secondary colours should only be used in conjunction with the
          primary palette. These should never be used as an alternative to the
          primary colours.


          We also have a palette of accent colours. These add character and
          vibrancy to illustrations, charts and marketing material. Accent
          colours should be used sparingly.

          The UI palette is made up of 12 colours, all of which are a gradient
          of the base colour ‘Colour ui 100’. The other colours in the palette
          are a percentage of the original base colour.

          The interaction palette list the colours used for different
          interactions on the site.

          The red interaction colour is purposefully not the same red as our
          brand palette.


          By creating a slight variant, we avoid any negative association with
          our brand red. The interaction red is also more accessible.

          The colours we use affect dyslexic users, as well as colour blind
          users. For dyslexic users, high contrast colours can make words appear
          to blur together.


          All of the colours in our text palette meet AAA standard on a white
          background. The main text headline colour is not pure black, as
          dyslexic users are sensitive to high contrast colours.


          When colours are used on a coloured background, check colour contrast
          using [webaim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) or a
          similar tool.
