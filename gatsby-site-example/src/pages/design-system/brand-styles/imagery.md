          All our imagery should communicate a sense of a mutually designed
          experience.


          We value diversity & inclusion for the mutual benefit of the Society,
          our members and their communities.

          We are built on a foundation of mutual benefit – where everyday people
          came together to pool their finances and build homes and communities
          for one another.


          We reflect this in our imagery by portraying real members within their
          homes and local communities.

          Our imagery should always reflect the diversity of the members and
          communities we serve.


          In practice, ensure that people are dressed appropriately, avoid hand
          gestures and any overtly religious or political symbolism.

          We all differ in our ability to see, hear, perceive colour, control
          our motion and understand concepts.


          Being mindful of these differences when using imagery makes room for
          every user.

          Photography is the primary visual medium we use to communicate our
          brand, products & services.


          Our photography must reflect candid, everyday moments in the lives of
          our members and communities.


          See our [photography](/design-system/brand-styles/photography/) styles
          for more guidance.

      - richtext: >-
          Illustration is our secondary visual medium helping users interpret
          information or complete tasks.


          For this reason, we need to be considerate of the user’s context and
          sentiment when adding illustration to an experience.


          See our [illustration](/design-system/brand-styles/illustration/)
          styles for more information.

          Photography can be used in both the hero and [card with
          image](/design-system/patterns/card-with-image) patterns.


          Illustration should only be used in the card with image pattern (never
          in the hero).

        type: headingBlock
      - richtext: >-
          For all imagery, set the focal point around the main area of interest
          (eg the person or object) so that no context is lost when the image
          resizes across breakpoints.

          Aspect ratio is the proportion of an image’s width to its height
          (width:height).


          For consistency across experiences, all our imagery must be in 16:9
          aspect ratio.

          We recommend image file sizes do not exceed 150KB.


          Large file sizes can negatively impact a webpage’s load speed –
          affecting usability, bounce rate and SEO.

    heading: Usage and placement
  - contentBlocks:
      - richtext: >-
          Alternative text, or ‘alt text’, is added to an image to help all
          users interpret meaning where they use a screen reader or
          text-to-speech function.


          Alt text can either be added:


          * to code as an ‘alt’ attribute.

          * near to the image on screen.


          Alt text should briefly describe key concepts or information
          represented by the image – not simply a description of the image
          itself.


          If the image is only decorative (removing it doesn't affect meaning),
          you don’t need to add alt text. You must add the alt attribute though
          to stop screen readers reading out the image’s file name.


          For more guidance on writing alt text, visit the
          [accessibility](http://www.noop.co.uk/) site.
