  Card headers form the upper container of the card pattern. They're used to
  introduce the card as a whole, and generally contain a title.

            There are currently 3 different patterns for the card header. These
            all follow the same spacing rules and are always copy-lead.

            1. **Product header<br>**
               The product header is the most prominent type of card header. The H3 text has extra bottom padding, to give it more space within the card. The product header uses a coloured background, which helps it stand out on a page. This pattern is currently only used in mortgage applications.
            2. **Section title header<br>**
               The section title header is the standard header type, and can be used with any card.
            3. **Product details header<br>**The product details card header is
            used for product-specific information. Unlike other card headers, it
            has a left and a right alignment.

            Headers have their own patterns, which vary depending on the
            content. Card headers must always be used at the top of a card
            pattern.

              items:
                - On every card.
                - To introduce the content of the card.
                - To separate information sections on a page.

              items:
                - Within other card headers.
                - Outside of a card pattern.
                - 'In isolation, without the supporting content.'

            Headers help users find the information they're looking for more
            quickly. It aids skim reading, and breaks up the content on the
            page.


            Card headers should summarise, or give an indication about the
            card's subject. Aim to make them informative, but easy to
            understand. Headers should use sentence casing, but they do not
            require a full stop.
