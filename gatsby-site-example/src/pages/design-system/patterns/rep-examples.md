            Rep examples are used every time we talk about unsecured borrowing.
            That means whenever we talk about a rate, charge or an offer, we are
            legally obliged to include a rep example.


            These offers, rates and charges are known as 'triggers'. Triggers
            and rep examples must be close to each other on the page.

            The header should always read 'Representative example' (not 'Your
            representative example' - as it's not personalised for each user).


            All other content needs to follow the strict guidelines of the FCA
            (Financial Conduct Authority). Take a look at the [FCA
            handbook](https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/CONC/3/5.html#DES96)
            for more information.
