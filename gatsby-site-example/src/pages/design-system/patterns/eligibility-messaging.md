  Some of our products and services require our users to meet certain conditions
  before they apply.


  These conditions are known as eligibility criteria and we communicate these
  within eligibility messaging.

            When creating eligibility messaging:


            * Try to avoid the word 'eligibility' itself for readability
            purposes.

            * Bullet list items should start with a capital letter and end with
            a full stop.

            * Headings should be set between H2-H4 in context of the hierarchy
            of the other headings on the page. Whichever you choose, headings
            will always be styled as an H4.
