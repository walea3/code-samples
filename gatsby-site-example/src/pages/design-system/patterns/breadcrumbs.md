  website’s hierarchy, helping users understand where they are in relation to
  the rest of the site.

            The breadcrumb pattern appears as a line of links, separated by
            chevrons. It runs from left to right, with the highest page in the
            site structure on the left. The active page is not shown in the
            breadcrumb.
