  Links, also known as text links, take the user to another location. They can
  link to content within the same page, to different pages or to other locations
  entirely.


  Links are sometimes styled as buttons. Find out more about [buttons and
  CTAs](/design-system/patterns/ctas-and-buttons/).

            Links are a well-established pattern across the web. Users generally
            know how to interact with links, and how they will behave.


            Further research and testing needs to be carried out to define clear
            usage rules for links.

            Links are used in isolation, where as inline links form part of a
            longer sentence.


            ### Links


            When writing link text:


            * Keep it short and action driven. 

            * Ensure links make sense on their own, as a single sentence. 

            * Do not use full stops for links that aren't part of a sentence.


            ### Inline links


            Inline text links are part of a longer sentence. When writing inline
            link labels:


            * Make sure the key information is part of the text link.

            * Avoid making an entire sentence a text link.

            Screen reader users often navigate from link to link, to quickly
            skim through content. Therefore, itâ€™s important that you tell your
            users where a text link will take them, or why they are being taken
            to a page.


            Avoid using repetitive phrases at the start of a text link, as this
            is unnecessary and can be frustrating for screen reader users.
