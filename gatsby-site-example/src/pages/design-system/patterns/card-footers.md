            There are many card footer patterns. Each one has a different
            purpose, depending on the card's content and the next steps in the
            journey.

            1. **Primary CTA** **<br>**
               A single CTA (Call to action) relates to the content in the card, giving the user the next step in their journey.
            2. **Primary CTA with link<br>**
               This pattern comprises a left-aligned text CTA and a right-aligned primary CTA. It takes to the user to the next step in their journey, while giving them the option to go back.
            3. **Primary CTA and link<br>**
               This right-aligned pattern includes a primary CTA and primary link sat next to each other. It's used for scenarios such as the terms and conditions acceptance pages.
            4. **Link<br>**
               This pattern includes a left-aligned link, which takes the user to another location.
            5. **Single selection <br>**
               A single selection uses a radio button, allowing the user to make one choice from a list of options.
            6. **Multi card selection <br>**
               With the checkbox pattern, users can choose multiple options from a list.
            7. **Expanding accordion<br>**
               In this pattern, the entire footer is expandable.

            Card footers provide the space to add an onward journey for the
            user. These can be in the form of a link, button or checkbox.


            This actionable content should relate to the subject of the card.
            It's important that the action is simple, so the user understands
            what to do next. Related actions should be written as clear
            alternatives, such as 'Next' and 'Back'.
