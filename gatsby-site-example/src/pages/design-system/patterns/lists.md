  Lists are a clean, easily scannable way of displaying content on a page. They break things down into bitesize chunks, making it quicker to read and easier to compare.

            There are several types of list patterns, all of which serve different purposes.

            Bullets and numbered lists stand out on a page and draw the readerâ€™s
            attention. Too many lists on a page reduce their impact. Therefore,
            lists should be used sparingly.


            When using icons lists, only use one type of symbol per list. For
            example, do not use ticks and a crosses in the same list.

            Every list includes a lead-in line and the text labels, which make up the list content.


            ### List lead-in


            This introduces the list and gives it context. Lists should always include a lead-in line or heading.


            ### Text labels


            If the bullets are self-contained sentences, they should start with
            a capital letter and end with a full stop. If they are not complete
            sentences, they should start with a lower case. Only the last bullet
            should end with a full stop.


            Numbered lists should start with a capital letter and end with a
            full stop.


            Be mindful about the number of entries in a list. Too many and the
            benefits of succinct, scannable content is lost.


            ### List patterns


            'How to' lists are mostly to help users understand a process. They
            are similar to numbered (ordered lists), but have some unique
            elements.


            * Don't use 'Click', 'Tap', 'Select'. Use **Choose.**

            * Don't put ' ' around actions that users can take (just use strong
            tags)

            * The call to action link should appear after the list, not inline
            within a bullet.


            ### Example of a 'How to' list.
