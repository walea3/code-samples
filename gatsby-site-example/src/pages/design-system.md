title: Design system overview
lead: >-
  A design system is a set of reusable patterns, which come together to form
  digital experiences. Every pattern has been created using defined standards
  and principles, with a focus on inclusivity and accessibility. It  ensures we
  always design, build and communicate consistently across our digital estate.
description: >-
  Our design system is made up of brand styles, layout foundations and patterns.
  These are assembled to form templates, and journeys. Everyone can contribute
  to it, and with NEL’s established standards, we’ll ensure it’s always evolving
  the right way.
